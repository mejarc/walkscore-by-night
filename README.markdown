# Walk Score By Night

Taking off from the truly wonderful, life-enhancing data provided by <WalkScore.com>, and attempting to answer the question, "Well, this place is a **great** pedestrian experience by day--but what about *after dark*?"

The plan: combine the "walkability score" returned for an address by Walk Score with data about that location's off-peak transit service, and with what's known about the [rate of violent crime](http://www.crimemapping.com/) around those parts, and, if possible, a survey of which businesses are open in that neighborhood at night. Is your high-scoring locale somewhere you'd want to be waiting for the (infrequently scheduled) bus after dark? Does that high score plummet when all the shops close up? 

This is in no way a condemnation of Walk Score's indispensable work, but rather an expansion of the concept of "walkability" to accommodate the sad truth that, however lovely a walk in the midday sunshine is, it's not always our portion.
